# Concertina

## ConcertinaMotionDemo

This sketch provides a simple demonstration of concertina motion.

### Getting Started

1. Set `NUM_SERVOS` to the number of servos in your robot.
2. Set the values of `forwardAngles` to the angles at which each servo (from head to tail) faces straight forward.
3. Modify the body of the `getServoPortNumber` function to reflect the scheme used for connecting servos on your robot (servo numbers are assumed to begin from `0` at the head of the snake and increase down the snake body).
4. Review other variables at the beginning of the sketch (the function of each is documented in the sketch).
